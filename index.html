	<h2>Fitlum enables its users gain information about the availability and schedule of Nelson Fitness center and OMAC Facility located in Brown University. Fitlum shares the number of people who are swimming, working out, playing basketball or running during the open hours of these facilities. In addition, it provides more intuitive data such as how many people there are for a single lane in the pool or in the track.</h2>
